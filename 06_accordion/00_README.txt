Accordions (Collapsible)

Accordions are an effective way to conceal/reveal information to the mobile

Bootstrap accordions can be set up with nothing but CSS tags to trigger the
relevant javascript; events can be intercepted, defaults prevented, and your
own custom code inserted by adding some javascript
