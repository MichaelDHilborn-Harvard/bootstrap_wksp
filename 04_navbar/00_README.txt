Navigation

Bootstrap offers many different types of navigation - the quintessential 
across-the-top navigation bar is easily made static or fixed via css, and
can easily have both left- and right- oriented elements, as well as drop-downs.
Menus easily collapse to the famous 'hamburger' on a phone.
