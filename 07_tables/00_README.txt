-Tables

Tables of any complexity present problems for mobile devices. The number of columns may not fit elegantly on small screens; the content of individual cells (headers and/or data) can be too long to display appropriately.

Boostrap handles striping, borders, hovers, and context for you pretty well:

*.table
*.table-striped
*.table-bordered
*.table-hover

can all be applied to a table element.


A coherent strategy for showing/hiding individual columns, and modifying the contents, has yielded the best results in my experience. Consult <code>hidden-{size}</code>  and <code>visible-{size}</code> in http://getbootstrap.com/css/#responsive-utilities. 

You can also make tables responsive by wrapping in a div with class="table-responsive", which will make them horizontally scrollable on small devices, if you still need to display all columns.
