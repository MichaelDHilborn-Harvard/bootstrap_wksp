ABCD bootstrap wksp 3/19/2015

Exercises to familiarize you with the essentials that Bootstrap has to offer.

The basic idea is to work through the exercises in directory order, starting
with 01 and if you have time to work through the more challenging exercises in 
08, well, you work quickly. :)

Files are in pairs; all '*_DONE.html' files contain one possible solution; there
are, of course, many others. The other html files are the starting points. All
exercises can be completed with CSS classes alone, but can also instead be 
completed with bootstrap.js - or some combination of the 2. The solutions 
provided are almost exclusively CSS solutions.

Open the starting file (e.g., '01_grid_breakpoints.html') in your favorite
text editor/IDE. I also suggest making use of index.html as an anchor for 
determining the layout of both starting and ending. This gives you a visual 
reference as you go along. 

Happy coding!
