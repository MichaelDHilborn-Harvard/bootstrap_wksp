# bootstrap_wksp
Created for ABCD bootstrap wksp 3/19/2015

Exercises to familiarize you with the essentials that Bootstrap has to offer.

The basic idea is to work through the exercises in directory order, starting
with 01-04 in ascending order, then picking through 05-08 in whatever order appeals
to you. If you have time to also work through the more challenging exercises in 
09 during the 90 minute workshop, well, then, you work quickly. :)

Sections 01-04 are mostly about CSS: http://getbootstrap.com/css/

Sections 05-08 refer more to the javascript portion of Bootstrap, although you can
accomplish much functionality with CSS and other attributes:
http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/

Files are in pairs; all '*_DONE.html' files contain one possible solution; there
are, of course, many others. The other html files are the starting points. All
exercises can be completed with CSS classes alone, but can also instead be 
completed with bootstrap.js - or some combination of the 2. The solutions 
provided are almost exclusively CSS solutions.

Open the index file in the root of the project in a web browser so that you can
see the starting and end states of the exercises (this will give you a visual 
reference as you work), then open the first project (e.g., '01_grid_breakpoints.html') 
in your favorite text editor/IDE. 
 
You may also find it useful to consult the 00_README.txt files in each section, 
as they contain information and useful links.

Happy coding!
